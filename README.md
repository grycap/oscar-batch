![OSCAR-logo](docs/images/oscar3.png)

OSCAR-Batch is a framework designed to perform batch-based processing using the OSCAR service. It leverages a coordinator to manage the distribution of inference tasks, ensuring efficient use of available CPU and memory resources in the OSCAR cluster. This setup allows for multiple inferences to be executed concurrently, optimizing the performance and scalability of the service. For more details on how the coordinator works, refer to the code provided.
